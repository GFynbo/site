For as long as I can remember, I have had a love for solving puzzles and for fiddling with whatever technology I can get my hands on. Fiddling is also what allowed me to get my foot in the door with programming and led to building my own computer at age 12. Challenging puzzles and problems like Sudoku encouraged me to deconstruct things which helped me build a nearly unbeatable tic-tac-toe AI and as a result, I developed a love for programming. The combination of my fascination with computers and lust for challenging puzzles led me straight to the field of computer science.

Using my programming skills, hard work, and clear communications I can work individually or with a team to build any program. That can include, a better search engine for finding well fitting clothes or a program to find traffic patterns to build better, more efficient cities.
